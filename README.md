*Voice Coil Motor* 
This is a project for designing and controlling a Voice Coil Motor. We will build a Coil Winder in order to wind the coil contained in the motor. Some parts are 3D printed and the structure is built with aluminium profiles. The winding movement is produced by two stepper motors, the slider and the winder, both controlled by an Arduino UNO board.
